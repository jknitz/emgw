<div class='mycontent' style='width:80%; margin:0 auto; '>
  <p>The project to build boxes of blocks was  completed in October.  
  The Clinton Early Childhood Resource Center provides services for children from Clinton and surrounding towns.  
  Many of these families participate in the Parent Child Home Program,and will use these blocks to support their 
  children's early language and social/emotional development.  
  The guild is bringing great joy to a few very young (3 to 4) children by providing them with a 
  very important toy and learning tool.
