    The Eliot School has been teaching since 1676.  In 1889 the school focused on manual arts and has been teaching classes in woodworking and other crafts since.  The Guild is proud to have formed an alliance with The Eliot School to help continue and support our mutual goal of educating and promoting excellence in woodworking.
    </p><p>
    The Guild has agreed to co-sponsor several woodworking classes and workshops offered through The Eliot School starting this fall.  The fall classes that we are co-sponsoring are: Basic Furniture Design, Furniture Finishing, Gilding &amp; Frame Restoration, and Inlay &amp; Veneer.  The workshops are Wood Carving, Wood Turning, and Surface Decoration on Wood. These classes and workshops are taught by professional woodworking instructors.  For a full description of the fall classes, instructor, time, and tuition check out <a href='http://www.eliotschool.org'>The Eliot School's web site</a>. The Eliot School, located in a beautiful residential neighborhood in a building built in 1831 near Jamaica Pond, has a complete and extensive wood shop.  Plenty of on-street parking is available.
    </p><p>
    Also watch for a mini-course on SketchUp for Furniture taught by the Guild's own expert, Jim Russell.  This is scheduled for winter term at The Eliot School.
    </p><p>
    Guild Members will receive at 10% discount on tuition on co-sponsored classes. When registering, please say you are a member of the Eastern Massachusetts Guild of Woodworkers.</p>
